Write a program that can read in values from a text file.
Extend the program to split the values at blank lines.
Extend the program to store each of the sets of values that have been split.
Extend the program so that it produces the sum of each of the sets of stored values.
Extend the program further so that it produces the sum of each of the sets and stores this in a new larger data set.
Return the highest value of that largest data set.
